# Investment Simulator

This code provides a Flask API for simulating and plotting investment scenarios over time.

## Usage

1. **Simulation Endpoint**: `/simulate` (POST)
   - Use this endpoint to simulate investments.
   - Input JSON format:
     ```json
     {
       "duration": 10,
       "initial_salary": 50000,
       "savings_rate": 20,
       "investments": [
         {
           "name": "Investment 1",
           "rate": 5,
           "initial_amount": 10000,
           "allocation_percentage": 50
         },
         {
           "name": "Investment 2",
           "rate": 8,
           "initial_amount": 20000,
           "allocation_percentage": 50,
           "fees": 1.5
         }
       ],
       "salary_changes": [
         {
           "year": 5,
           "new_salary": 60000
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Output JSON format:
     ```json
     [
       ["Investment 1", 123456.78],
       ["Investment 2", 98765.43]
     ]
     ```

2. **Plotting Endpoint**: `/plot` (POST)
   - Use this endpoint to plot investment data.
   - Input and output formats are similar to the simulation endpoint.
